      Hi, I'm Samuel Le Meur-Diebolt.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a Research Fellow in the laboratory of 
    <a href="https://www.carandinilab.net">Prof. Matteo Carandini</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab">Prof. Kenneth Harris</a> at 
    <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I recently defended my PhD, where I applied 
    <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-neuro-111020-100706">functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI)</a> 
    for fingerprinting of pharmacological alterations in awake and behaving mice. 
    During my doctoral research, I developed denoising and analysis tools for functional ultrasound imaging.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am passionate about increasing fUSI's adoption through the development of open resources, 
    such as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3z01mf1E8cfg_OY7ZGqeUeOKv659jCHQBXavtmT-T8/edit?usp=sharing">fUSI-BIDS specification</a>, 
    currently under community development.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests include functional connectivity, systems neuroscience, and neuroimaging methods development.
